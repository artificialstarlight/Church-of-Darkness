# Church of Darkness    
An occult horror puzzle text adventure made in python.    
## Warning: Flashing Lights    
If you have epilepsy or a similar condition, playing this game is probably not a good idea.    
### Another warning    
If you're going to look at the code, this was written when I was very new to python. While it works, expect bad coding practices and general cringeworthiness.
## How to Run:    
### Windows    
Run `Darkness.exe`
### \*NIX    
Open a terminal and run `./main.bin` in the directory.
**BINARIES CURRENTLY DO NOT WORK FOR LINUX. THERE'S BUGS.**
