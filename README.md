# Church of Darkness

Church of Darkness is a WIP occult horror puzzle text adventure meant to be played in the
  terminal of Linux systems.

Warnings: Some endings of this game may have flashing lights. 
          Due to the nature of this game, expect graphic descriptions and 
             possibly offensive content in terms of religious and cult-like themes.
             In terms of language and sexually explicit content, however, there is none. 
 

How to install: Have Python 3 installed and run darkness1.py as a python 
                  script in the terminal.

Another warning: If you're going to look at the code, this was written when I was very new to python. While it works, expect bad coding practices
and general cringeworthiness.
