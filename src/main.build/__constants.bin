        The returned instance is actually always an instance of `SessionBus`,
        `SystemBus` or `StarterBus`.

        :Parameters:
            `bus_type` : cls.TYPE_SESSION, cls.TYPE_SYSTEM or cls.TYPE_STARTER
                Connect to the appropriate bus
            `private` : bool
                If true, never return an existing shared instance, but instead
                return a private connection.

                :Deprecated: since 0.82.3. Use dbus.bus.BusConnection for
                    private connections.

            `mainloop` : dbus.mainloop.NativeMainLoop
                The main loop to use. The default is to use the default
                main loop if one has been set up, or raise an exception
                if none has been.
        :Changed: in dbus-python 0.80:
            converted from a wrapper around a Connection to a Connection
            subclass.
        Static method that returns a connection to the starter bus.

        :Parameters:
            `private` : bool
                If true, do not return a shared connection.
        A connection to one of three possible standard buses, the SESSION,
    SYSTEM, or STARTER bus. This class manages shared connections to those
    buses.

    If you're trying to subclass `Bus`, you may be better off subclassing
    `BusConnection`, which doesn't have all this magic.
    Return a connection to the system bus.

        :Parameters:
            `private` : bool
                If true, never return an existing shared instance, but instead
                return a private connection.
            `mainloop` : dbus.mainloop.NativeMainLoop
                The main loop to use. The default is to use the default

    INTROSPECT_STATE_INTROSPECT_DONEignore_reply_dbus_interfaceThe bus name to which this proxy is bound. (Read-only,
            may change.)

            If the proxy was instantiated using a unique name, this property
            is that unique name.

            If the proxy was instantiated with a well-known name and with
            ``follow_name_owner_changes`` set false (the default), this
            property is the unique name of the connection that owned that
            well-known name when the proxy was instantiated, which might
            not actually own the requested well-known name any more.

            If the proxy was instantiated with a well-known name and with
            ``follow_name_owner_changes`` set true, this property is that
            well-known name.
            requested_bus_name_DeferredMethod.__call__Return a proxy method representing the given D-Bus method. The
        returned proxy method can be called in the usual way. For instance, ::

            proxy.get_dbus_method("Foo", dbus_interface='com.example.Bar')(123)

        is equivalent to::

            proxy.Foo(123, dbus_interface='com.example.Bar')

        or even::

            getattr(proxy, "Foo")(123, dbus_interface='com.example.Bar')

        However, using `get_dbus_method` is the only way to call D-Bus
        methods with certain awkward names - if the author of a service
        implements a method called ``connect_to_signal`` or even
        ``__getattr__``, you'll need to use `get_dbus_method` to call them.

        For services which follow the D-Bus convention of CamelCaseMethodNames
        this won't be a problem.

        The parameters and keyword arguments are the same as for
        `dbus.proxies.ProxyObject.connect_to_signal`, except that if
        `dbus_interface` is None (the default), the D-Bus interface that
        was passed to the `Interface` constructor is used.
        Arrange for the given function to be called when the given signal
        is received.

        :Parameters:
            `signal_name` : str
                The name of the signal
            `handler_function` : callable
                A function to be called when the signal is emitted by
                the remote object. Its positional arguments will be the
                arguments of the signal; optionally, it may be given
                keyword arguments as described below.
            `dbus_interface` : str
                Optional interface with which to qualify the signal name.
                If None (the default) the handler will be called whenever a
                signal of the given member name is received, whatever
                its interface.
        :Keywords:
            `utf8_strings` : bool
                If True, the handler function will receive any string
                arguments as dbus.UTF8String objects (a subclass of str
                guaranteed to be UTF-8). If False (default) it will receive
                any string arguments as dbus.String objects (a subclass of
                unicode).
            `byte_arrays` : bool
                If True, the handler function will receive any byte-array
                arguments as dbus.ByteArray objects (a subclass of str).
                If False (default) it will receive any byte-array
                arguments as a dbus.Array of dbus.Byte (subclasses of:
                a list of ints).
            `sender_keyword` : str
                If not None (the default), the handler function will receive
                the unique name of the sending endpoint as a keyword
                argument with this name
            `destination_keyword` : str
                If not None (the default), the handler function will receive
                the bus name of the destination (or None if the signal is a
                broadcast, as is usual) as a keyword argument with this name.
            `interface_keyword` : str
                If not None (the default), the handler function will receive
                the signal interface as a keyword argument with this name.
            `member_keyword` : str
                If not None (the default), the handler function will receive
                the signal name as a keyword argument with this name.
            `path_keyword` : str
                If not None (the default), the handler function will receive
                the object-path of the sending object as a keyword argument
                with this name
            `message_keyword` : str
                If not None (the default), the handler function will receive
                the `dbus.lowlevel.SignalMessage` as a keyword argument with
                this name.
            `arg...` : unicode or UTF-8 str
                If there are additional keyword parameters of the form
                ``arg``\ *n*, match only signals where the *n*\ th argument
                is the value given for that keyword parameter. As of this time
                only string arguments can be matched (in particular,

    Reader.this_machineWait for a change in the journal.

        `timeout` is the maximum time in seconds to wait, or None which
        means to wait forever.

        Returns one of NOP (no change), APPEND (new entries have been added to
        the end of the journal), or INVALIDATE (journal files have been added or
        removed).
        COREDUMP_SIGNALConvert entire journal entry utilising _convert_field.Return a file object wrapping a stream to journal.

    Log messages written to this file as simple newline sepearted text strings
    are written to the journal.

    The file will be line buffered, so messages are actually sent after a
    newline character is written.

    >>> from systemd import journal
    >>> stream = journal.stream('myapp')                       # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> res = stream.write('message...\n')                     # doctest: +SKIP

    will produce the following message in the journal::

      PRIORITY=7
      SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=myapp
      MESSAGE=message...

    If identifier is None, a suitable default based on sys.argv[0] will be used.

    This interface can be used conveniently with the print function:

    >>> from __future__ import print_function
    >>> stream = journal.stream()                              # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> print('message...', file=stream)                       # doctest: +SKIP

    priority is the syslog priority, one of `LOG_EMERG`, `LOG_ALERT`,
    `LOG_CRIT`, `LOG_ERR`, `LOG_WARNING`, `LOG_NOTICE`, `LOG_INFO`, `LOG_DEBUG`.

    level_prefix is a boolean. If true, kernel-style log priority level prefixes
    (such as '<1>') are interpreted. See sd-daemon(3) for more information.
    Add match for log entries with specified `messageid`.

        `messageid` can be string of hexadicimal digits or a UUID
        instance. Standard message IDs can be found in systemd.id128.

        Equivalent to add_match(MESSAGE_ID=`messageid`).
        CODE_LINE={:d}_get_realtimeget_nextConvert value using self.converters[key].

        If `key` is not present in self.converters, a standard unicode decoding
        will be attempted.  If the conversion (either key-specific or the
        default one) fails with a ValueError, the original bytes object will be
        returned.
        _convert_entryReader.seek_monotonicReturn the next entry in the journal.

        Returns self.get_next() or raises StopIteration.

        Part of the iterator protocol.
        THREAD_NAMEJournalHandler.map_priorityMap logging levels to journald priorities.

        Since Python log level numbers are "sparse", we have to map numbers in
        between the standard levels too.
        Access systemd journal entries.

    Entries are subject to filtering and limits, see `add_match`, `this_boot`,
    `this_machine` functions and the `data_treshold` attribute.

    Note that in order to access the system journal, a non-root user must have
    the necessary privileges, see journalctl(1) for details.  Unprivileged users
    can access only their own journal.

    Example usage to print out all informational or higher level messages for
    systemd-udevd for this boot:

    >>> from systemd import journal
    >>> j = journal.Reader()
    >>> j.this_boot()
    >>> j.log_level(journal.LOG_INFO)
    >>> j.add_match(_SYSTEMD_UNIT="systemd-udevd.service")
    >>> for entry in j:                                 # doctest: +SKIP
    ...    print(entry['MESSAGE'])
    starting version ...

    See systemd.journal-fields(7) for more info on typical fields found in the
    journal.

    processNameRUNTIME_ONLYSeek to a matching journal entry nearest to `timestamp` time.

        Argument `realtime` must be either an integer UNIX timestamp (in
        microseconds since the beginning of the UNIX epoch), or an float UNIX
        timestamp (in seconds since the beginning of the UNIX epoch), or a
        datetime.datetime instance. The integer form is deprecated.

        >>> import time
        >>> from systemd import journal

        >>> yesterday = time.time() - 24 * 60**2
        >>> j = journal.Reader()
        >>> j.seek_realtime(yesterday)
        CODE_ARGSReader.__iter__Reader.query_unique.<locals>.<genexpr>SYSTEM_ONLYINITRD_USECSeek to a matching journal entry nearest to `monotonic` time.

        Argument `monotonic` is a timestamp from boot in either seconds or a
        datetime.timedelta instance. Argument `bootid` is a string or UUID
        representing which boot the monotonic time is reference to. Defaults to
        current bootid.
        Journal handler class for the Python logging framework.

    Please see the Python logging module documentation for an overview:
    http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html.

    To create a custom logger whose messages go only to journal:

    >>> import logging
    >>> log = logging.getLogger('custom_logger_name')
    >>> log.propagate = False
    >>> log.addHandler(JournalHandler())
    >>> log.warning("Some message: %s", 'detail')

    Note that by default, message levels `INFO` and `DEBUG` are ignored by the
    logging framework. To enable those log levels:

    >>> log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    To redirect all logging messages to journal regardless of where they come
    from, attach it to the root logger:

    >>> logging.root.addHandler(JournalHandler())

    For more complex configurations when using `dictConfig` or `fileConfig`,
    specify `systemd.journal.JournalHandler` as the handler class.  Only
    standard handler configuration options are supported: `level`, `formatter`,
    `filters`.

    To attach journal MESSAGE_ID, an extra field is supported:

    >>> import uuid
    >>> mid = uuid.UUID('0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF')
    >>> log.warning("Message with ID", extra={'MESSAGE_ID': mid})

    Fields to be attached to all messages sent through this handler can be
    specified as keyword arguments. This probably makes sense only for
    SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER and similar fields which are constant for the whole
    program:

    >>> JournalHandler(SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER='my-cool-app')
    <...JournalHandler ...>

    The following journal fields will be sent: `MESSAGE`, `PRIORITY`,
    `THREAD_NAME`, `CODE_FILE`, `CODE_LINE`, `CODE_FUNC`, `LOGGER` (name as
    supplied to getLogger call), `MESSAGE_ID` (optional, see above),
    `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` (defaults to sys.argv[0]).

    The function used to actually send messages can be overridden using
    the `sender_function` parameter.
    EXCEPTION_INFO__REALTIME_TIMESTAMPReturn a list of unique values appearing in the journal for the given
        `field`.

        Note this does not respect any journal matches.

        Entries will be processed with converters specified during
        Reader creation.
        Return the previous log entry.

        Equivalent to get_next(-skip).

        Optional `skip` value will return the -`skip`-th log entry.

        Entries will be processed with converters specified during Reader
        creation.

        Currently a standard dictionary of fields is returned, but in the
        future this might be changed to a different mapping type, so the
        calling code should not make assumptions about a specific type.

        MESSAGE is taken from the message provided by the user, and PRIORITY,
        LOGGER, THREAD_NAME, CODE_{FILE,LINE,FUNC} fields are appended
        automatically. In addition, record.MESSAGE_ID will be used if present.
        exc_textLog level must be 0 <= level <= 7_convert_uuidCOREDUMP_GIDAdd match for _MACHINE_ID equal to the ID of this machine.

        If specified, machineid should be either a UUID or a 32 digit hex
        number.

        Equivalent to add_match(_MACHINE_ID='machineid').
        Send a message to the journal.

    >>> from systemd import journal
    >>> journal.send('Hello world')
    >>> journal.send('Hello, again, world', FIELD2='Greetings!')
    >>> journal.send('Binary message', BINARY=b'\xde\xad\xbe\xef')

    Value of the MESSAGE argument will be used for the MESSAGE= field. MESSAGE
    must be a string and will be sent as UTF-8 to the journal.

    MESSAGE_ID can be given to uniquely identify the type of message. It must be
    a string or a uuid.UUID object.

    CODE_LINE, CODE_FILE, and CODE_FUNC can be specified to identify the caller.
    Unless at least on of the three is given, values are extracted from the
    stack frame of the caller of send(). CODE_FILE and CODE_FUNC must be
    strings, CODE_LINE must be an integer.

    Additional fields for the journal entry can only be specified as keyword
    arguments. The payload can be either a string or bytes. A string will be
    sent as UTF-8, and bytes will be sent as-is to the journal.

    Other useful fields include PRIORITY, SYSLOG_FACILITY, SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER,
    SYSLOG_PID.
    _extra%s.%fSESSION_IDPROCESS_NAMELEADERReader.get_nextlevelno_AUDIT_SESSION_AUDIT_LOGINUIDfdopenUSERSPACE_USEC/usr/lib64/python3.8/site-packages/systemd/journal.pyCreate a new Reader.

        Argument `flags` defines the open flags of the journal, which can be one
        of, or ORed combination of constants: LOCAL_ONLY (default) opens journal
        on local machine only; RUNTIME_ONLY opens only volatile journal files;
        and SYSTEM_ONLY opens only journal files of system services and the kernel.

        Argument `path` is the directory of journal files, either a file system
        path or a file descriptor. Note that `flags`, `path`, and `files` are
        exclusive.

        Argument `converters` is a dictionary which updates the
        DEFAULT_CONVERTERS to convert journal field values. Field names are used
        as keys into this dictionary. The values must be single argument
        functions, which take a `bytes` object and return a converted
        value. When there's no entry for a field name, then the default UTF-8
        decoding will be attempted. If the conversion fails with a ValueError,
        unconverted bytes object will be returned. (Note that ValueEror is a
        superclass of UnicodeDecodeError).

        Reader implements the context manager protocol: the journal will be
        closed when exiting the block.
        JournalHandler.__init__Set maximum log `level` by setting matches for PRIORITY.
        _get_allReader.messageid_matchsend.<locals>.<genexpr>EXCEPTION_TEXTmapPriorityReader.log_levelReader.wait__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMPCOREDUMP_TIMESTAMPAdd one or more matches to the filter journal log entries.

        All matches of different field are combined with logical AND, and
        matches of the same field are automatically combined with logical OR.
        Matches can be passed as strings of form "FIELD=value", or keyword
        arguments FIELD="value".
